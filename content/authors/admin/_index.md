Jeffrey Kopsick is a 3rd year PhD Student at George Mason University, working in the lab of Giorgio Ascoli. His research interests include the creation and simulation of data-driven spiking neural networks, and to use those networks to better understand how the hippocampus works at the level of individual cell types.
